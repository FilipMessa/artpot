title: Detected Landscape
description: "The title of the exhibition Detected landscape refers to the quest
  of update of dealing with the genre of landscape painting and of the landscape
  as such. The very broad framework of this update could be located in the new
  contemporary geological epoch of Anthropocene and the presence of
  all-encompassing technologies of detection and surveillance — whether that of
  satellite pictures or drone recordings. These changes in the global scope are
  connected to the deromanticizing of the natural landscape as such, as well as
  to its comprehension as a certain fluid space - not only geographical and
  geological, but also political, cultural and social one. In her newest series,
  Petra Mešša continues to elaborate on the topic of the so-called banal
  landscape, this time in the media of painting, photography and video. She is
  not interested in the representation of the grand mountains covered in snow or
  of endless valleys, which were and without doubt are inspiring for existential
  sighs and folk or pop-music ditties. Petra chooses such views and fragments
  from the repertoire of landscape, in case of which nothing specific or
  shallowly picturesque appears on the first sight. The artist creates the
  series, where the centre of attention occupies e.g. a puddle, a tree stump or
  a pile of wooden trash. These familiar and at the same time precisely
  unlocalizable objects and structures always bear an imprint of a human hand in
  themselves - at least as an index - somebody had to make the hole in the
  pavement, in which water stuck, to cut the tree to its ground. A certain
  kaleidoscope of everydayness is being created, which due to the repetition of
  the motifs can paradoxically turn out in two different ways. On the one hand,
  these banal motifs can be elevated as symbols - puddle as a symbol of a
  natural cycle, tree stump as a symbol of time written in annual rings. On the
  other hand, these normally overlooked and aesthetically not-so-appealing
  pictures can appear as if they were lacking something. It is so because they
  are connected to the broader picture of the landscape in our memory, to
  another stimuli than visual ones only. Petra departs from (or returns to?)
  realistic oil painting, that she wittily uses to render aforementioned banal
  motifs, to photography, paying sort of homage to genealogy of the landscape
  representation. Another stage (or register) of her representation of the
  landscape is video. Static camera prevents us to perceive more than a
  fragmentary picture chosen by the author. This picture is accompanied in this
  case with an essential further information - that of the sound, but stuck in
  one place while watching flowing waters into each other, one can only
  conclude: panta rhei - so what? Precisely this moment of fluidity, fleeing and
  realizing of the differences in these three different modes of representation
  and our position as a subject reflecting on our own position within the
  landscape, constitutes the framework of the detecting of the banal landscape
  by Petra. The artist is aware of the fact that she is working with the
  pictures of Central-European landscape, geographically and aesthetically
  anchored in a continuity or opposition to tradition and at the same time in a
  lineage of thinking about landscape, coined by terms contemporary romanticism
  or constructive lyric (Mária Janušová). A certain contemplative aspect,
  simplicity of the motifs and their rendering is in intentional opposition to
  predominance of visual smog, although the artist’s approach to the material is
  heading towards more analytical searching of landscape, landscape, which is
  being touched, affected and detected. (Miroslava Urbanová)"
