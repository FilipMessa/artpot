  In this work I focused on the fate of the drawing depository and the original
  drawings, respectively, that were made at the Division of drawing throughout
  several semesters. While attempting to acquire the material from students‘
  personal archives I faced difficulties awarding/denying the value of such
  artworks, since most of them were destroyed by the authors themselves. I was
  interested in the story of these drawings – the moments in which the effort to
  create an artwork turns – through its photographic documentation, rolling and
  archiving – into just a physical material. Its unavailability and difficult
  manipulation with a paper roll further forces the author to only use the
  digital archive, which takes over the value of the artwork that the original
  drawings are missing. Thus, the originals become a matter that turns into its
  primary form of a paper roll, mainly carrying the legacy of its physical use
  than its artistic value.
