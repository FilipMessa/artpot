title: The ceiling connects with the couch
description: >-
  It constrains by its location, but at the same time it provides a shelter when
  a man needs to confide while looking at the sky, a shelter where silence is
  not in vain and a place that listens and always knows how to respond. The
  space defined by it provides certainty of actuality and its heaviness bears
  all human failings. Its outcome is unselfish, without expectation of payback
  and it never divulges what is kept out of it. When a man needs to ask and
  guesses that only he/she can answer, he turns for help with a look at the
  ceiling.
