title: Is there a time to be void? Why not
description: >-
  This thesis focuses on the process of personalization, socialization and
  communication today. It discusses the issue of changes to the traditional
  arrangement of society, manifested in a new form of individualism and its
  consequences for the individual and the whole society. The main line of the
  practical part of the thesis was to mediate social experience without the
  possibility of achieving artistic fulfillment. This includes seeking
  fulfillment in communication and cohesion or on the other hand, in conflict
  within the group of people who attended the exhibition. This effort was
  accompanied by reflections on the role of the contemporary artist and
  reforming the status of contemporary art and artwork as such (Does it make
  sense nowadays to constitute artistic artifacts, i.e. extra commodities in the
  oversaturated world of consumerism? To what extent is artwork an intellectual
  capital and when it becomes goods? Can be a situation that will not peak in
  any artistic experience considered a work of art?). The result of this work
  should be a confrontation between artist and audience. The confrontation could
  happen on the spot or in a broader sense after reviewing the event. The event
  was focused on viewer's action on such an occasion and his ways of coping with
  frustration, which the situation inevitably brought.
