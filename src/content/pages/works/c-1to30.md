title: C 1to30
description: >-
  The title C 1to30 refers to the symbol of carbon as a chemical element, which
  should encourage the viewer to perceive my installation through the view of
  the drawing tool – the charcoal stick – enlarged by a scale 1:30 compared with
  the original. At the same time, its vertical column-like position indicates
  insecurity of the supporting (carrier) element in relation to the architecture
  of the gallery, because this column seems burnt and thus insecure, unreliable
  just like the drawing made by it, which usually requires a fixative to
  preserve it from erasure
